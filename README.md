# FogCreekChallenge

FogCreekChallenge involves taking input and finding the secret word.

You can compile the program yourself on the command line, if you so choose with:

`swiftc main.swift Input.swift -o program`

I've included the compiled program file for your convenience, to run enter:

`./program`
